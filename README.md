# streetview_publish_api_example
A WORKING (unlike Google's) example of publishing photo spheres to Street View using Street View Publish API 

# Install
```
git clone https://github.com/nextu1337/streetview_publish_api_example.git
```
and then inside the folder
```
npm install
```
after that replace your credentials.json with what google gave you after creating service account

# Run
```
node index.js PHOTOSPHERE_NAME.JPG
```

TODO: use oauth2 to upload photos from your own account instead of service account
